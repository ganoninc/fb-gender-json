# fb-gender-json
A Facebook generated name list with their gender in a JSON file.

The aim of this list is to be used for social network analysis.

The JSON format makes it easier to use.

## About

**There are two lists available:**

1. **fb-gender.json** *(firstname.csv)*
2. **fb-gender-extended.json** *(firstname.csv + Prenoms.csv)*

The first list is an adaptation of "[
What's in a Name: A Study of Names, Gender Inference, and Gender Behavior in Facebook](https://sites.google.com/site/facebooknamelist/home)".

The second list was obtained by merging the first one and the data from the website [lexique.org](http://lexique.org/telAutresBases.php).
